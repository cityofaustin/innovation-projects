The Displacement Mitigation Action Accelerator is a 3-day event where we want to catalyze community-generated concepts that contribute to displacement mitigation. This is a space where you will find all the ingredients of possibility together, we need your combinatorial creativity to work smarter, not harder, against this complex problem. 
What’s inside? 
We want to make the concepting process as smooth as possible, so we are providing some important background content to keep in mind and to inform your work. 
1. Problem framing: This is a framework of what we are trying to solve for, blockers to work around and desired outcomes that concepts should solve for or tend to. 
2. “We need ideas that…”: In this section we ask you to think around some big constraints (think Texas legislation or limited resources), but also, we want you to think about the speed and magnitude of the problem. 
3. “Therefore, any concepts presented need to…”: This section presents our evaluation criteria. This is what a potential successful concept looks like. 
4. “This is what the day of will look like…”: This section outlines our schedule, activities and what will happen at the end of each day.
