**Follow the signs!** 

There will be signs in the parking garage elevators, as as well as private event signs on the gallery entrance doors and outside the 2nd St. entrance. 

**Directions to the Gallery:**

The event is in the Gallery, located on the 2nd floor of the Central Library, accessible via the main entrance of the library. 

**Parking:**

Due to limited onsite parking at the Central Library, you are encouraged to carpool and use alternative modes of transportation. For those parking at the Central Library’s underground garage, the entrance is located on West Avenue. Anyone arriving before 9:30 AM should just alert the security guard at the gate that they are here for the event!

Please take the northernmost elevator (closest to 2nd St.) from either P1 or P2 to the 2nd Floor of the Central Library. The main entrance is out of that elevator and to the right.

**In case the Central Library’s parking garage is full:** 

The nearest public parking is available in the Seaholm District. You may use either metered street parking along Power Plant Dr. or the parking garage with entrance located on Walter Seaholm Dr. The Library will have  parking validator available for you, and the garage will bill you after your event for any tickets you choose to stamp!

Free parking is always available at City Hall. You can validate parking at the Clerk's desk and then walk over to the Central Library.
