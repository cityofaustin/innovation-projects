# The Displacement Mitigation Action Accelerator 

## Nov. 12th - 13th & Dec. 13th 


The City of Austin Office of Innovation invites you to the Displacement Mitigation Action Accelerator! The Accelerator is a 3-day event to catalyze community-generated concepts that contribute to mitigate displacement•. 

This is a space where you will find all the ingredients of possibility together. We need your combinatorial creativity to work smarter on solutions to tackle this problem. 


### What is this event about? 

This is a unique opportunity to work on possible solutions to displacement and get seed money to build evidence about concepts that work to fight displacement! We have designed a space for you and community collaborators to build an accelerated pathway for displacement mitigation interventions in three areas that will significantly impact this problem in Austin: 

   
    A. evictions and predatory pressures; 
    B. alternate income generating or cost reduction options for homeowners; and 
    C. holistic service packages and combinations designed to stabilize people in their homes

### How to participate? 

We want to be intentional and focused, so we request that you put forward concepts you or your organization have regarding one of the three subjects mentioned above. To participate at the event, please: 

1. Review the problem frame you want to work on
2. Think of a concept –related to the problem frame– that you have been wanting to try for a while   
   *Hint: The right concept is something you have thought before and said: ‘This could work!’. Think of what will impact          communities in the near-term future.*
3. Once you have decided on a concept, fill out this form
4. Come to the event on Nov. 12th ready to iterate on your concept and collaborate!

•*For the purposes of this event, displacement is moving from your home when you do not want to, and it is connected to gentrification*
