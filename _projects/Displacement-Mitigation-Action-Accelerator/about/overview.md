# Save the Date for the Displacement Mitigation Action Accelerator 

## Nov. 12th - 13th & Dec. 13th 


Join us in a space designed for you to join others on cross-sector teams to build an accelerated pathway for your ideas to mitigate displacement. You’ll have an opportunity to get seed money to build evidence of what works in collaboration with your community.

**1. Work Sessions: Nov. 12th - 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM // Nov. 13th - 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM**
⋅⋅* The best teams will get free technical assistance to flesh out their idea

**2. Pitch Session: Dec. 13th - 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM**
⋅⋅* An evaluation panel will choose between 3-6 awards to receive funds to build evidence that the idea works in community.

**Invitation and more information, including location, will follow.** 


After our first day of activities we are heading to the Austin Impact Accelerator. It will be a great way to get inspiration for our work ahead. [Register here](https://go.impacthubaustin.com/accelerator-community-showcase-day).
