Since we began this project, we've been putting together regular presentations for our advisory groups and stakeholders. 
In November, 2017, we opened these share-outs to the wider community. We'll be posting our slide decks — we recommend viewing with presentation notes visible — in addition to supplementary materials such as recordings or question and answer documentation.
