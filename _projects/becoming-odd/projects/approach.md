## The unit of delivery is the team

Our approach to projects is focused on reaching desired outcomes (not pre-determined solutions) and empowering multi-disciplinary teams to make their own decisions on how to reach those outcomes.

This is different than the typical processes of government executives expecting a specifically-defined deliverable and assigning one or two people to add it to their already-packed schedule of projects and initiatives. Our leadership team spends significant effort defining space for our teams to explore possible solutions and be 100% dedicated to one project at a time.

The resources in this section are the foundation of that effort â€“ our partnership agreements, our approaches to agile and iterative design, and our processes for collaborating within and across teams.
