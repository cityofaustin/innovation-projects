## The Project

Austin, Texas frequently appears at the top of many top 10 lists. The metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in the country, with a high economic growth and low unemployment rates that encourages an estimated [105 people to move here per day](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/02-21-2019-austin-migration).

As economic prosperity and Austin’s frequent listing as one of the best places to live make it an increasingly attractive community, population increases have resulted in [rising property values](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/NHCD/Strategic_Housing_Blueprint_4.24.17__reduced_.pdf). However, not all share in Austin’s prosperity. This dynamic has resulted in gentrification, the process by which higher income households displace low income residents of a neighborhood, changing the essential character of that neighborhood. According to a study by the University of Toronto, Austin ranks first amongst cities of 1 million residents or more in being the [most economically segregated](http://martinprosperity.org/media/Segregated%20City.pdf).

### Gentrification and displacement

**A recent [research study by the University of Texas at Austin](http://sites.utexas.edu/gentrificationproject/) identified that out of 200 neighborhoods, 16 are “actively gentrifying,” and 23 more that are at risk of gentrification.** The UT study identified that most vulnerable residents in those neighborhoods (those who have low-income, are people of color, have not achieved a bachelor’s degree are higher, are families with children in poverty, and whose housing status are renters) are most likely to experience displacement.

In his 2018 State of the City Address, [Mayor Adler said](http://www.mayoradler.com/mayor-adlers-state-of-the-city-address-part-8/) “We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past any more than we can afford the cost that the status quo is imposing on our community. Our job is to prevent an unacceptable future. After years of unimplemented ideas, we need to do something to address displacement.”

By “the mistakes of the past,” the Mayor was referring to Austin’s legacy of institutionalized racism that have created [systemic inequities](https://cityofaustin.github.io/institutional-racism/IRSI_Task_Force_Report-Updated-4-6-17.pdf). These include:

   1. During the 1870’s–1920’s original Black “Freedman” towns and Hispanic/Latino populations were forced to move into settlements outside of what was then the city of Austin into communities such as Clarksville, St. John’s, and Montopolis - neighborhoods currently facing gentrification pressure.
   2. The City’s 1928 Master Plan created a “Negro District” on the East side of Austin. Those historic neighborhoods are currently facing extreme gentrification pressure, or are in late stages of gentrification.
   3. From 1910 through the 1920s Blacks lived throughout the center of Austin with concentration along the eastern side of downtown, while “Mexican American” households were concentrated in a neighborhood in the southwest of downtown. These neighborhoods are currently experiencing, or are at risk of experiencing, gentrification pressure.
   4. The Industrial Development Plan of 1957 zoned all property in East Austin “industrial,” including single family residential uses. Polluting industries were allowed to remain, and residents were not allowed to get bank loans for home repair, so-called “red-lining,” which laid the groundwork for gentrification. East Austin faces gentrification pressure.
   5. Urban Renewal programs of the 1960s-1970s became known as Urban Removal, displaced people of color from large areas, and turned formerly residential land into parks and schools without providing adequate opportunities for displaced households to return.
   6. Since the 1990s, zoning changes in East Austin have accelerated gentrification, without efforts to mitigate displacement.

As a result of collaborative efforts between Mayor, Council, City Management and staff, the recently adopted City of Austin [Strategic Direction 2023](https://austinstrategicplan.bloomfire.com/posts/3301043-austin-strategic-direction-2023-final) identifies a strategy of “Develop and act upon recommendations to reduce the number of households and businesses displaced from Austin due to unaffordability.”  In 2018, Austinites voted to approve a $250 million affordable housing bond, and a resident Task Force on Anti-Displacement issues recommendations to provide a right to remain and a right to return for Austin residents.

## iTeam Grant Requirements

The purpose of the grant is to add an innovation capacity to a city. Grant funds may only be used for salaries and benefits, and for expenses related to the iTeam’s work. Teams are expected to go through a rigorous process of framing problems before engaging in solutioning or connecting to ideas.

## The Plan

### Phase 1 - Discovery - conduct research in 3 parallel streams: 

1. **Ethnographic Study**: Interviews with those with lived experience of homelessness, service providers, and community members to learn more about their experience and perspectives. 
2. **Quantitative Research**: Inventory data to identify areas of opportunity for better integration, knowledge sharing, and potential investments. 
3. **ARCH Service Mapping**: Understanding the experience of people with lived experience in Austin, the role that the ARCH plays in their experience, and a service blueprint for the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (ARCH). 

After the initial research, we’ll pull together insights based on what we’ve learned and our recommendations for moving forward. 

### Phase 2 - Concepting & Prototyping

During this stage, we’ll begin designing and prototyping options for how to achieve the project’s desired outcomes. We’ll develop options based on the information gathered during the Discovery stage and test them with different types of users to understand how they work well and how they can be improved. This might include designing and testing different user interfaces, ways of providing geographic information about organizations, and internal administration of the system.
