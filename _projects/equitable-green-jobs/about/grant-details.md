### Grant Eligibility

Applicants may apply jointly, however, dispersal of grant funds shall be made directly to the primary organization / sole fiscal sponsor only.

### Evaluation Criteria

**Demonstrable experience working with the population in focus.**
In your application, please provide background on your experiencing serving the population in focus.

**Semi-formal cooperation between two different types of organizations**

Preference will be given to respondents who establish a cooperating agreement between at least two different types of organizations:

  * Community organizing
  * Youth engagement, training, or leadership development

  * Urban design and landscaping
  * Agriculture and food production
  * Waste management
  * Energy production, systems, and management

The agreement to cooperate should establish a semi-formal relationship to share information and allow for some programmatic coordination over the term of the grant to enable a higher likelihood of success. The agreement to cooperate can be submitted as a letter to accompany the application.

Any more formal collaboration or partnership between organizations is at the discretion of those organizations, and is not required as a preferential condition. Should organizations decide to sub-contract, note that subcontractors should also be registered to do business with the City of Austin prior to applying. 

Grant funds shall be distributed directly to the primary organization / sole fiscal sponsor only.
