## Development of a Smart City Strategic Roadmap

In November 2016, Austin City Council passed a [resolution](https://smartaustin.bloomfire.com/posts/1327070-city-of-austin-moving-forward-with-a-smart-cities-strategic-roadmap) calling for the development of a Smart City Strategic Roadmap with relevant City entities, community partners, and the technology community.

City Council asked that our strategic roadmap include the following:

* A common, Austin-centered definition of Smart Cities
* A statement of vision about Austin’s Smart Cities future
* Challenges on which we should focus and prioritize
* Potential opportunities to address those challenges
* Key goals and outcomes operationally for the City and for residents’ equitable quality of life
* An inventory of practices to consider
* Core needs, gaps, and capabilities to deliver
* Potential resources and means for partnering and financing initiatives
* A prioritized list of projects to pursue.

Around the same time, the City of Austin developed its first [strategic framework](https://austinstrategicplan.bloomfire.com/posts/3222339-strategic-direction-2023-final-adopted-3-8-18) in more than a decade. This framework outlines the most pressing challenges facing Austin over the next five years, and we use these challenges to frame and prioritize smart city projects. The Austin City Council adopted Strategic Direction 2023 in March 2018.
