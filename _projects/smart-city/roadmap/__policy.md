> *Of all the prospects raised by the evolution of digital culture, the most tantalizing is the possibility that technology could fuse with politics to create a more civil society. -  [Jon Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Katz)*

## Strategic Intent

A statement with a point of view about the future, a sense of discovery and destiny that focuses attention, motivates, guides resources, allows for flexible implementation.

## Decision-Making

Policies and process for framing, making, and weighing tradeoffs. Data-informed decisions require 1) reliable quantitative and qualitative data, 2) active consideration of data

## Governance

The way the rules, norms, standards, and actions are structured, sustained, and regulated; and how teams are held accountable.

## Discovery phase feedback that led to this section

During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice from participants through an [insights campaign](http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights). We learned:

> "The City needs to identify the decision makers and explain the decision-making process for Smart City projects."

> "Contributors suggested the City measure against benchmarks (some of which already exist) so that Austin can check progress against achieving our goals."

> "Contributors suggest that the City needs to facilitate connections and leverage existing programs supporting City Council outcomes."

> "Improvements to the City’s procurement process are critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects."

> "Contributors suggested that Smart City projects should be flexible and adaptable over time."

> "Contributors suggested that the City approach Smart Cities with a regional and geographically-distributed focus instead of concentrating solutions or ignoring interconnectedness of systems."

> "The City needs to effectively engage all residents to account for the value proposition of projects based on existing needs and accessibility of solutions."

> "The City needs a better identified entryway for specific solutions and technologies to be heard and receive feedback."

> "Smart City projects that should be balanced with a focus on both existing needs and future-oriented opportunities."

> "The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships."

> "Contributors noted many considerations for managing Smart Cities as a program, including: goals, maturity, measures, value/cost drivers, critical infrastructure, and key resources."

> "There is a need for a concerted effort on privacy and security that includes policies, processes, and staffing."

> "Contributors said the city needs to enable a state of readiness for agile and iterative implementation of projects.

> "The City needs to develop guidance to support prototyping and experimenting in an ethical and transparent way."

## Challenge areas identified

* How might we provide transparent governance of smart city projects?
* How might we measure our progress in achieving smart city goals compared to other cities?
* How might we use the City Council’s strategic outcomes to prioritize smart city projects?
