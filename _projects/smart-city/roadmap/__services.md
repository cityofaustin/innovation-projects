> *Personalized e-government services increase citizen satisfaction and compliance while reducing mistakes and misunderstandings that can occur when they are forced to dig up information on their own.* - Darren Bates in [The Secret Sauce of a Successful Smart City](https://austinstartups.com/the-secret-sauce-of-a-successful-smart-city-2b4967f70f71).

## Outcomes

Demonstrate tangible outcomes and experiences for the Austin community.

## Value Proposition

A belief from the customer about how value (benefit) will be delivered, experienced and acquired.

## Data as a Service

Reusable, open data and open interfaces (APIs), enable data from one service to be combined with data from another to create interesting data combinations and integrations.

## Discovery phase feedback that led to this section

During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice from participants through an [insights campaign](http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights). We learned:

> "The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships."

> "Contributors suggest that the City needs to facilitate connections and leverage existing programs supporting City Council outcomes."

## Challenge areas identified

* How might we value data as an asset in our service delivery and in our partnerships?
* How might we define and provide guidance for data ownership and intellectual property in City projects?
