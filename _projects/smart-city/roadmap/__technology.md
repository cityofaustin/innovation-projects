We believe smart cities conversations shouldn't start with the technology but rather with the problem you're trying to solve. That said, technology is what powers smart cities projects and enables them to scale and serve more people.

## Discovery phase feedback that will be incorporated into this section

During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice from participants through an [insights campaign](http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights). We learned:

> "Projects should be continuously learning and adapting, powered by technology that enables flexibility and avoids vendor lock-in."

> "Contributors suggested that Smart City projects should be flexible and adaptable over time."

## Challenge areas identified

* How might we enable projects to have quick learning loops that allow them to adapt to change quickly?
* How might we encourage smart city projects to adopt a service-oriented architecture that enables integrations across systems and operates in a vendor-agnostic way?
