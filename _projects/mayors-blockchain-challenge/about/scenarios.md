You don’t have to wait until the 28th to start working on your solution! Use the scenarios and resources below to start now. Make sure your build can handle all the points in each scenario, as well as these general requirements:

**Your solution should be able to handle:**
* Bulk document uploads
* Notation of assets that are verified in real life
* Smart contracts
* An opt-in/consent process
* Built on a private blockchain
* Non-transferable assets

## Scenario 1 - Released 07/13/2018

### The Setup
Steven Smith has been homeless on and off for the past decade since experiencing major health issues. He is currently living in an encampment in South Austin and regularly checks in at Sunrise Community Church with Maggie, one of their staff members who helps people experiencing homelessness navigate the complexity of receiving services.
 
Today, Steven walks into Sunrise and overhears a conversation about this new technology that allows you to have a digital copy of your ID, so if you lose your ID (or it’s stolen), you still have a form of valid identification.
 
He grabs a cup of coffee and finds Maggie to ask her about the platform. He has his Texas driver’s license but is nervous that it will be stolen like his phone was last week. Can she help get him on the system and create a trusted copy of his ID?

### Build requirements
* At least two entities, one for Steven and one for Maggie. Maggie's entity should also belong to a parent entity, Sunrise Community Church.
* At least one asset with an image of the Texas driver's license attached.
* Final state of a validated and verified ID asset on Steven's profile that cannot be reassigned.
* Please also include a flow diagram of how your solution works.
* In order for an ID to be valid, it needs to be both *validated* as an actual ID and *verified* that it belongs to the person claiming it. This must be done by a person of established authority and not Steven (the person claiming the ID).

* UI interface prototypes*
* Steven Smith persona
* Maggie Yun persona
* Texas driver's license image file
* myPass branding standards

<sub>&#42;This is meant to illustrate only one possibility of how the Steven and Maggie might experience the interaction.</sub>

### Things to keep in mind
* How will you show that this ID is validated and verified?
* How will it be accessed to read or use?
* How would you use blockchain to solve this scenario?
* How else might you solve it?
* Is blockchain better? Why/why not?
