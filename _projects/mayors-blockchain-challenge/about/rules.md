### Guidelines for participation
When you [join the event on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-mayors-blockchain-challenge-tickets-48004157728?aff=Website), you'll receive email updates with increasingly complex use case scenarios to solve. By July 28, you should have a solution that covers all the scenarios to test and present. The hackathon starting on July 27 will give you extra time and space to meet with your team, build and refine on site, and test your solution with real users.

### Teams
While you can enter as an individual, we highly encourage teams that include at least a blockchain developer and a front end developer. Your team can consist of people located remotely, but each team must have at least one member who can attend and present your solution in Austin during the hackathon (July 28-29).

Ideas and solutions presented must be developed for this challenge by the participants representing them.

### How do I participate as a community member?
Are you a services provider or person with lived homelessness experience? We'd love for you to participate as a consultant or subject matter expert. Please contact innovation@austintexas.gov with your interest.
