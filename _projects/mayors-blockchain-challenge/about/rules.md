### Guidelines for participation
When you [join the event on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-mayors-blockchain-challenge-tickets-48004157728?aff=Website), you'll receive email updates with increasingly complex use case scenarios to solve. By July 28, you should have a solution that covers all the scenarios to test and present. The hackathon starting on July 27 will give you extra time and space to meet with your team, build and refine on site, and test your solution with real users.

### Submissions
To be considered for a prize, your submission to the Challenge must consist of the following (at minimum):
* Consensus algorithm
* 5-minute presentation of your solution that includes these slides (you can include additional slides as well):
  * Who you are
  * Which service packages you chose
  * The elements you included
  * A solution diagram
  * Test results
* Any prototypes you create 

All submissions are due by 10am on Sunday, July 29.

### Prizes
The winning team in the challenge will receive $2,000, and the runner up team will receive $1,000!

### Judging criteria
[Submissions will be judged using this criteria.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkND7igdV-ls9vo_NVLHP7R70cCYF1Dz3a7DXoLlMls/edit?usp=sharing)

### Teams
While you can enter as an individual, we highly encourage teams that include at least a blockchain developer and a front end developer. Your team can consist of people located remotely, but each team must have at least one member who can attend and present your solution in Austin during the hackathon (July 28-29).

Ideas and solutions presented must be developed for this challenge by the participants representing them.

### How do I participate as a community member?
Are you a services provider or person with lived homelessness experience? We'd love for you to participate as a consultant or subject matter expert. Please contact innovation@austintexas.gov with your interest.
